## Background

I made `apex-dt` to solve two problems:

- I wanted to be able to get useful information quickly while I'm in a game or matchmaking queue, without needing to open my browser, navigate to some website, search for the info, distinguish ads from content, etc.

- I also wanted to capture my match history and save it in a structured database, so that I can do my own analysis with tools of my choice, and not need to rely on third party tools.

## Install

Install `apex-dt` using one of the following methods.

### Via PyPI.org

***TODO. Coming soon!***

```
pip install apex-dt
```

### Via GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/1npo/apex-dt.git
cd apex-dt
pip install .
```

### Setting up your credentials

***TODO:*** ... 

## Usage

***TODO:*** ...

## Information currently available through `apex-dt`

`apex-dt` makes the following information available:

- All the information made available through my [`apex-wiki-get`](http://github.com/1npo/apex-wiki-get) package.
- Information made available through Hugo's Apex Legends API:
	- General player stats for the players you're tracking
	- Match history for the players you're tracking
	- Current crafting rotation
	- Current map rotation
	- Predator/other leaderboards
	- Server status
	- Apex Legends News

Please see [the TODO file](TODO.md) for features I'm working on, and [the change log](CHANGELOG.md) for the features added in each version.
